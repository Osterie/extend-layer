# Extend layer

The preset profiles are HEAVILY "inspired" by the extend layer created by DreymaR [link](https://dreymar.colemak.org/layers-extend.html). Check it out.
If you use this program i recommend reading about the extend layer and copying this [Image](https://dreymar.colemak.org/res/div/Extend/Extend-ISO-NoMod-Win_96d-Labels.png) since it is basically the layout of the preset profile. In the future i will create a better way to keep track of which keys are where and what they do, since the extend layer i have created is not identical to the DreymaR extend layer.

!WARNING! If you start using the Extend Layer, you will NEVER go back.
The extend layer makes navigation a lot more ergonomic and fast. I highly reccomend learning the shortcuts from the extend layer [WebPage](https://dreymar.colemak.org/layers-extend.html#:~:text=F12%20is%20faster.-,GENERAL,-SHORTCUTS).

My favorite use for the extend layer, is coding in an IDE, for example VsCode. The extend layer really complements the existing shortcuts of VsCode and makes coding a lot faster, more ergonomic and more satisfying.

## Summary
1. Remap keys to new keys or new functionalities using a Gui.
2. Create Multiple virtual keyboards.
3. Create your own scripts and run them with a key bind.

## What does Extend layer do?
### Extra virtual keyboards
Extend layer allows you to create multiple virtual keyboards. This is useful if you have a keyboard with a limited amount of keys, or if you want to create a keyboard for a specific program. For example, you can create a keyboard for a game, a keyboard for coding, a keyboard for browsing, etc. You can switch between these keyboards with a chosen keybind. By default the keybind is "CapsLock" to switch to a second keyboard layer and "Capslock + Shift" to switch to a third keyboard layer. You can change these keybinds to whatever you want.

### Rebinding keys to another key or a special action
The program allows you to rebind keys to other keys or special actions. 
For example, you can rebind the [I, J, K, L] keys to [Up, Left, Down, Right] to easily switch to navigating without having to move your right hand across half the universe to reach the arrow keys.

Additionally, you can rebind the keys, for example "a" to a special action like changing screen brightness, traveling to a url, excecuting a script, and much more.


## How to use this program?
After following the [getting started guide](#getting-started).
Run ExtraKeyboardsApp.ahk. This will open a gui where you can add some premade profiles, or create your own profile, and edit keybinds.
