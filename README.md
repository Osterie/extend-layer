### Example of a predefined virtual keyboard

Below is an example of a predefined virtual keyboard, found in the **Default** profile. The image shows the layout of the second virtual keyboard of this profile, which is activated by hitting **CapsLock**.

![Default extra virual keyboard layout](../images/assets/READMEImages/KeyboardLayoutDefault.png?raw=true)

This profile moves the keys used for text navigation, text editing, browser navigation, and such, often found far from the center of the keyboard, to the center of the keyboard.

The program has multiple of these predefined profiles with predefined virtual keyboards, and you can create your own custom profiles with virtual keyboards.

### How the gui looks

![Default extra virual keyboard layout](../images/assets/READMEImages/OverviewOfGui.png?raw=true)

This shows the main window of the program. Here you can add profiles, edit profiles, add keybinds, edit keybinds, delete keybinds, and switch between different profiles. For information on how to actually do this, follow the guides in ["How to use this program?"](#how-to-use-this-program)

## What does Extend layer do?

### Extra virtual keyboards

Extend layer allows you to create multiple virtual keyboards, and different profiles each containing different virtual keyboards. This is useful if you have a keyboard with a limited amount of keys, or if you want to create a keyboard for a specific program. For example, you can create a profile containing keyboards for a game, keyboards for coding, keyboards for browsing, etc. You can switch between the different keyboard in a profile using a chosen keybind. By default the keybind is **CapsLock** to switch to a second keyboard layer and **Capslock + Shift** to switch to a third keyboard layer. You can change these keybinds however you want.

An example of one of the predefined keyboards, found in the **Default** profile, is shown below.  The default profile is created when you first download and run the application. The image shows the layout of the second virtual keyboard of this profile, which is activated by hitting **CapsLock**

![Default extra virual keyboard layout](../images/assets/READMEImages/KeyboardLayoutDefault.png?raw=true)

As you can see this keyboard moves the keys used for text navigation, text editing, browser navigation, and such, often found far from the center of the keyboard, to the center of the keyboard.

The Arrows keys, Home, End, Page up, Page down, Del, Backspace, Undo, Cut, Copy, Paste and the modifier keys are especially useful. These keys are found far from the center of the keyboard, but this keyboard layer moves them to the center. This is especially useful if, lets say, you work in a code editor, which often requires you to navigate a lot, either by mouse or keyboard. By moving the navigation keys to a more ergonomic position, you can navigate faster and more comfortably. It's very easy to just press "o" (End) to reach the end of a line, instead of clicking it using the mouse, or reaching a far distance with your right hand to press the end key.

#### Extra

!WARNING! If you start using the Extend Layer, you will NEVER go back.
The extend layer makes navigation a lot more ergonomic and fast. I highly reccomend learning the shortcuts from the extend layer [webpage](https://dreymar.colemak.org/layers-extend.html#:~:text=F12%20is%20faster.-,GENERAL,-SHORTCUTS).

My favorite use for the extend layer, is coding in an IDE, for example VsCode. The extend layer really complements the existing shortcuts of VsCode and makes coding a lot faster, more ergonomic and more satisfying.


### Rebinding keys to another key or a special action

The program allows you to rebind keys to other keys or special actions. 
For example, you can rebind the [I, J, K, L] keys to [Up, Left, Down, Right] to easily switch to navigating without having to move your right hand across half the universe to reach the arrow keys.

Additionally, you can rebind the keys, for example **a** to a special action like changing screen brightness, traveling to a url, excecuting a script, and much more.


## How to use this program?

1. [Add/Create a new profile](#how-to-addcreate-a-new-profile)
2. [Add/Modify/Delete a key bind](#how-to-addmodifydelete-a-key-bind)

After following the [getting started guide](#getting-started).
Run the program (through "Run_this.ahk"). This will open a gui where you can add some premade profiles, or create your own profile, and edit keybinds.

### How to add/create a new profile?

1. Click the **Add Profile** button.

![Add profile button image](../images/assets/READMEImages/AddProfileHighlighted.png?raw=true)

2. A dialog will open where you can select a predefined profile and choose a name for the profile.

![Choose a profile image](../images/assets/READMEImages/AddProfileDialogOpen.png?raw=true)

3. After selecting a profile, and giving it a unique name, click **Add Profile**.

There are some predefined profiles to choose between, but if you want to create your own profile from scratch you can select **EmptyProfile**.

Some profiles have a suffix like **_en** or **_no** which means that the profile is created for a specific keyboard layout. For example, **_en** is for the english keyboard layout and **_no** is for the norwegian keyboard layout.

![Create your own profile image](../images/assets/READMEImages/AddProfileCreatingOwnProfile.png?raw=true)

4. All done! You have created a new profile. You can now edit the keybinds and add new keybinds to your liking for this profile.

### How to add/modify/delete a key bind?

1. Select the profile you want to edit.

![The current profile highlighted](../images/assets/READMEImages/CurrentProfileHighlighted.png?raw=true)

2. Click on the **Keyboards** tab. This will show all the keyboard layers for the selected profile.

![Different keyboard layers highlighted](../images/assets/READMEImages/KeyboardLayersHighlighted.png?raw=true)

3. Click on the keyboard layer you want to edit. This will show all the keybinds for the selected keyboard layer. From here you can add, edit or delete keybinds. 

If you haven't selected an existing keybind, only the **add** keybind button is enabled. If you select an existing keybind, the **edit** and **delete** keybind buttons are enabled.

![buttons for adding, editing or deleting a hotkey highlighted](../images/assets/READMEImages/AddEditDeleteHotkeyHighlighted.png?raw=true)

4. Add, edit or delete a keybind by clicking the corresponding button.
- [Add a keybind](#add-a-keybind)
- [Edit a keybind](#edit-a-keybind)
- [Delete a keybind](#delete-a-keybind)

#### Add a keybind

1. After following the steps above, click the above highlighted **Add** button. (Alternatively you can press enter if the focused element is the different layers section (left side with GlobalLayer-Hotkeys and such))

2. A dialog will open where you have to have to set the hotkey and the action. The hotkey is the key you want to bind to a new action. The action is what you want the hotkey to do. Action can be a special action or a new key.
- [Set Hotkey](#set-hotkey)
- [Set Action](#set-action)

![Dialog for adding a hotkey](../images/assets/READMEImages/AddHotkeyDialog.png?raw=true)

##### Set Hotkey

1. Click the **Set Hotkey** button.

2. A dialog will open where you can set the hotkey. There are two different modes to this. [*Simple*](#simple) and [*advanced*](#advanced), which can be switched between by clicking the **Advanced mode** button.

3. Follow the guide [*Simple*](#simple) or [*advanced*](#advanced) hotkey setting.

4. Remember to also set an [action!](#set-action)

###### *Simple*

To set the hotkey you want, simply select the highlighted input field and press the key you want to bind to the action. You can also press key modifiers like shift, alt and ctrl, however not Win.

After choosing a keybind, press the save button.

3. Follow the guide [*Special Action*](#special-action) or follow parts of the [*Set Hotkey*](#set-hotkey) guide. When setting the new action to be a new key it is pretty much the same as the guide for setting a new hotkey (the image below is for setting a new key)

![Setting an action to a new key](../images/assets/READMEImages/SetActionNewKey.png?raw=true)

###### Special Action

To set the action to a special action, you need to select the action you want from the dropdown menu. After selecting the action, press the save button.

After selecting an action you will get an some information:
1. Action description: describes what the selected action does. 
2. Action to do: what the action does.
3. Action parameters: what parameters the action takes. For example, if the action is to change screen brightness, the parameter could be a number between 0 and 100, where 0 is the lowest brightness and 100 is the highest brightness. You yourself must fill out the parameters for an action to your liking.

After you have selected an action an filled out it's parameters, save!
